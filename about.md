<p>I'm currently a second year masters student at the University of Wisconsin, Madison working in the
<a href="https://williamspaleolab.github.io/">Williams' Paleo Lab</a>. My interests broadly surround
the fields of paleoclimatology and paleoecology, and my current research is at the nexus of these two
fields. My research is attempting to detect and predict abrupt changes, while taking into account the
role of temperature in driving these rapid compositional changes in vegeation during the deglaciation.
This project will also attempt to further test the efficacy of branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol
tetraethers (GDGT) as a paleothermometer in lacustrine environments. My goal with this research is to
advance our understanding of ecological abrupt changes, with the vision of having my research inform
resource managers and policymakers about how to observe key signs prior to abrupt change that stems
from emprical evidence. </p>

<p>Prior to graduate school I completed a Bachelors of Science in Environmental Science and
Management, in the Climate Change and Air Quality track, from the University of California, Davis.
While at UC Davis I worked at the Hastings' Lab and the Sih Lab as a research assistant, and my time
at these labs lent me invaluable insights into the world of academic research.</p>
