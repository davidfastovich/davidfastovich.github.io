Abrupt global changes that share rates of climate change similar to those experienced today (Overpeck et al. 2003; Williams and Burke 2019) are recorded throughout the geologic record and offer important insights that can help predict future anthropogenic change. The Deglacial period (19,000 to 11,000 years before present) after the Last Glacial Maximum has been a key interval for understanding ecological and climatological responses to increasing greenhouse gas concentrations and a warming climate (COHMAP Project Members 1988; Nolan et al. 2018; Mottl et al. 2021). Imposed on this gradual warming are abrupt climate oscillations that onset within decades to centuries, last for millennia, and are commonly attributed to changes in the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation forced by the input of freshwater into the North Atlantic Ocean. The most recent of these millennial-scale climate events is the Younger Dryas (ca. 12,900 to 11,700 years before present) and caused spatially complex climate changes globally. In this dissertation, we first aim to determine the spatial patterns of climate change and the atmospheric mechanisms responsible for driving abrupt climate change regionally in eastern North America through the use of organic temperature biomarkers (brGDGTs) and climate models. Second, we seek to disentangle the contributions of glacial and millennial-scale climate variability upon modern patterns of species richness in eastern North America.\nChapter 2 seeks to determine the spatial fingerprint of Younger Dryas temperature changes in eastern North America. We develop a spatially dense multiproxy network of temperature reconstructions relying upon statistical transfer functions applied to fossil-pollen abundances and an independent proxy, based on organic biomarkers (brGDGTs). This analysis indicates that temperature changes during the Younger Dryas followed a dipole pattern in eastern North America. Temperatures lowered abruptly in maritime Canada and the northeastern United States nearly synchronously with temperature records from Greenland (Severinghaus et al. 1998). Cooling is also reconstructed in the Great Lakes region but delayed by ~400 years. Sites south of 35°N exhibited an antiphased response and lack YD cooling, with Florida sites indicating a thermal maximum. Warming in Florida during the Younger Dryas suggests that the ‘bipolar-seesaw’ conceptualization is an oversimplification of the spatial patterns of global climate changes. Focus must be placed on constraining regional climate changes to refine the mechanisms of abrupt climate change. Chapter 3 aims to better understand the atmospheric mechanisms for these antiphased temperature changes in eastern North America. We accomplish this by combining our multiproxy temperature network with a synthesis of hydroclimate reconstructions to compare against four climate models with meltwater hosing experiments that resemble the onset of the Younger Dryas. Precipitation changes followed a tripole pattern with wetting in the northeastern United States and Florida and drying from the Great Lakes region to the Carolinas, in contrast to the temperature dipole resolved in Chapter 2. Analysis of the climate models highlights the dual role of ice sheets and meltwater-induced weakening of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation as the key drivers of the reconstructed warming and wetting in the southeastern United States. Reduced northward oceanic heat transport in the Atlantic Ocean increased the latitudinal temperature gradient and strengthened the jet stream, leading to upper-level divergence over eastern North America and the transport of warmer and moister air into the southeastern United States. For Chapter 4, we use our multiproxy temperature and precipitation reconstruction from prior chapters, alongside 11 climate simulations of millennial-scale climate events forced by meltwater pulses, to assess whether legacies of these climate changes can be detected in the contemporary diversity of amphibians, birds, mammals, reptiles, and trees in eastern North America. Generalized additive models that use both contemporary and paleoclimatic predictors suggest that past millennial scale climate oscillations have left an imprint on contemporary amphibian and arboreal biodiversity, though the exact role of past climate changes remains uncertain. Generalized additive models that use the multiproxy network of Younger Dryas climate reconstructions and a subset of the climate models analyzed suggest that greater millennial scale climate variability is predictive of greater contemporary biodiversity. However, generalized additive models that use four of the climate models suggest that millennial-scale climate stability is predictive of greater contemporary richness in eastern North America. Disagreement in the sign, magnitude, and spatial fingerprint of climate changes among the 11 climate simulations and the multiproxy climate reconstructions precludes further refining the role of millennial-scale climate oscillations at this time. This uncertainty highlights that caution should be used when attempting to model contemporary biodiversity based on individual paleoclimatic simulations. Higher resolution climate simulations forced with accurate boundary conditions are necessary to constrain the relationship between past millennial-scale climate changes and contemporary biodiversity.","tags":["Paleoclimatology","Fossil-pollen","brGDGT","Biodiversity","Climate Model"],"title":"Patterns, mechanisms, and legacies of abrupt climate change: examining the Younger Dryas in eastern North America","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Fastovich"],"categories":["Python","xarray","Jupyter","Binder"],"content":"During my dissertation research, I began playing with climate model output, which ended up integral in two of my three chapters.

Researchers commonly share their code and data through various academic repositories like Zenodo or public code repositories like GitHub, however, there remains a limitation to easy reproducibility: creating the computing environment that produced the code. The computing environment encompasses everything about the computer that was used to produce the final analyses and figures from the operating system to the coding language version and packages used for analyses. This is where Binder comes in - this is a free service that creates a virtual computer in the cloud based on the specifications listed in a GitHub repository. In the process of building the environment, Binder also clones the GitHub repository making it painless to reproduce analyses. From an end user’s perspective, this means that GitHub repositories that link to Binder environments allow someone to view the code, click a single button, and within minutes begin running that code on a computer in the cloud. Binder is particularly well suited for scientific computing done using R and Python because these code languages are freely accessible.\nThis introduction will teach you how to build an R Binder environment that can be used through Jupyter Notebooks or RStudio. This guide assumes that you have some experience with GitHub and are able to build your own public code repository. Once you have you’re GitHub repository live (we’ll use this introduction to the Neotoma Paleoecology Database I wrote some time back as an example), you need to a couple of files to the repository. First, you need to add a file named runtime.txt to the root of the GitHub repository with a single like that specifies the R version you would like Binder to install. In the example, I ask Binder to use R version 3.6 released on 2019-04-12 but adding this single line to the text file:\nr-3.6-2019-04-12 Important note - Binder builds R environments from MRAN, the Microsoft R Application Network, which is usually a few releases behind CRAN, The Comprehensive R Archive Network. So be sure to use a version of R that’s hosted on MRAN.\nAfter that, if your code has any package dependencies, you specify these to install in a file named install.R that is located in the root of the GitHub repository. Using the previous example, the install.R file has the following lines to install required packages:\ninstall.packages(\u0026#34;tidyverse\u0026#34;) install.packages(\u0026#34;rmarkdown\u0026#34;) install.packages(\u0026#34;httr\u0026#34;) install.packages(\u0026#34;shinydashboard\u0026#34;) install.packages(\u0026#34;leaflet\u0026#34;) install.packages(\u0026#34;neotoma\u0026#34;) install.packages(\u0026#34;rioja\u0026#34;) install.packages(\u0026#34;Bchron\u0026#34;) From here, all you need to do is create a live link to Binder in a markdown file on the root of the GitHub repository. The structure of the link follows a simple syntax where:\n[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)] is markdown for “link this text inside of this badge image”, and\n(https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/davidfastovich/R-Jupyter-Tutorial/main?urlpath=lab) tells Binder what repository to download and what program to open it in. Here, https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ links to Binder v2 and specifies that it should look at a GitHub repository (gh), from user davidfastovich, titled R-Jupyter-Tutorial. The last bit, /main?urlpath=lab tells Binder to open JupyterLab on launch, but this can be configured to open RStudio by changing it to main?urlpath=rstudio. So, the line in the markdown file would read either\n![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/davidfastovich/R-Jupyter-Tutorial/main?urlpath=lab) for JupyterLab or\n[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/davidfastovich/R-Jupyter-Tutorial/main?urlpath=rstudio) for RStudio.\nAnd that’s all there is to it! This is quite a lot of text for a simple process: you create three files on the root of the GitHub repository and link to Binder. In all, this should take ~5 minutes and can greatly extend open science!\nBelow are two links that will launch the example repository in Binder in JupyterLab or RStudio:\nJupyterlab RStudio Hopefully, playing with code within Binder has demonstrated its use for open science, but also demonstrated that Binder can be a powerful educational tool. I’ve taken many coding classes and the first barrier to entry was getting the coding environment set up on a personal computer. Binder resolves that issue entirely - students don’t have to worry about installing or upgrading anything, it’s all handled by the instructor.\n","date":1631145600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1631145600,"objectID":"32ba5260935081d2355a84650b6b2ef5","permalink":"https://davidfastovich.github.io/post/r_jupyter/","publishdate":"2021-09-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/r_jupyter/","section":"post","summary":"Reproducible science is best facilitated by open science.

The demise of Picea forests/woodlands during the last deglaciation offers a model system for studying how changing climate and disturbance regimes interact to trigger declines of dominant species and vegetation-type conversions. The role of rising temperatures in driving the regional demise of Picea forests/woodlands is widely accepted, but the role of fire is poorly understood. We studied the effect of changing fire activity on Picea declines and rates of vegetation composition change using fossil pollen and macroscopic charcoal from five high-resolution lake sediment records. The decline of Picea forests/woodlands followed two distinct patterns. At two sites (Stotzel-Leis and Silver Lake), fire activity reached maximum levels during the declines and both charcoal accumulation rates and fire frequency were significantly and positively associated with vegetation composition change rates. At these sites, Picea declined to low levels by 14 kyr BP and was largely replaced by deciduous hardwood taxa like ash Fraxinus, hop-hornbeam/hornbeam Ostrya/Carpinus and elm Ulmus. However, this ecosystem transition was reversible, as Picea re-established at lower abundances during the Younger Dryas. At the other three sites, there was no statistical relationship between charcoal accumulation and vegetation composition change rates, though fire frequency was a significant predictor of rates of vegetation change at Appleman Lake and Triangle Lake Bog. At these sites, Picea declined gradually over several thousand years, was replaced by deciduous hardwoods and high levels of Pinus and did not re-establish during the Younger Dryas. Synthesis. Fire does not appear to have been necessary for the climate-driven loss of Picea woodlands during the last deglaciation, but increased fire frequency accelerated the decline of Picea in some areas by clearing the way for thermophilous deciduous hardwood taxa. Hence, warming and intensified fire regimes likely interacted in the past to cause abrupt losses of coniferous forests and could again in the coming decades.","tags":["Charcoal","Abrupt Ecological Change","Fossil-pollen","brGDGT"],"title":"More than One Way to Kill a Spruce Forest: The Role of Fire and Climate in the Late-Glacial Termination of Spruce Woodlands across the Southern Great Lakes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Fastovich","James M.

We also reanalyze a previously published brGDGT record from Silver Lake, Ohio, using improved chromatographic methods. All pollen- and brGDGT-based temperature reconstructions showed qualitatively similar deglacial trends but varying magnitudes. Separating 5- and 6- methyl brGDGTs resulted in substantially lower estimates of deglacial temperature variations (6.4 degrees C) than inferred from earlier brGDGT methods and pollen (11.8 degrees C, 12.0 degrees C respectively). Similar trends among proxies suggest good fidelity of brGDGTs to temperature, despite calibration uncertainties. At both sites, the rise and decline of no-analog communities closely track brGDGT-inferred temperatures, with a lag of 0-150 years. The timing of temperature and ecological events varies between Bonnet and Silver Lakes, likely due to age model uncertainties. Climate sensitivity analyses indicate a linear sensitivity of vegetation composition to temperature variations, albeit noisy and significant only with a 500-year bin.

Branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGT) have recently been applied to reconstruct temperature at Silver Lake, OH, where the resulting temperature estimates closely tracked a regional pollen temperature reconstruction for the southern Great Lakes region. Here, we present the second brGDGT temperature record in this region, at Bonnet Lake, OH, using a new method for brGDGT detection and four alternative calibration functions, and reanalyze sediments from Silver Lake. We compare results across brGDGT detection methods, between sites and among calibration functions, and assess calibration uncertainty using a Bayesian linear regression. Of the calibration functions, MAT MBT′5Me reproduced the regional pollen stack and existing temperature record from Silver Lake most closely but is ~2°C warmer on average than the existing brGDGT temperature record. In the Bayesian regression analyses, the 95% credible interval when using the calibration from Weijers et al. (2007) was +/- 12.3°C. The MAT MBT′5Me calibration from De Jonge et al. (2014) had a smaller uncertainty (+/- 9.8°C 95% credible interval), likely resulting from a reduced sensitivity of brGDGT methylation to pH. These uncertainties are based only on analyses of the calibration data and likely overestimate reconstruction uncertainty, because calibration soil samples are heterogenous at the sampling scale and are at locations distant from the corresponding temperature measurement. Uncertainty can be reduced by creating improved calibration datasets of modern lake sediments. Despite uncertainty in absolute temperature and range, climatic trends are closely similar among brGDGT reconstructions and provide insight into the temperature drivers of past vegetation dynamics. Picea decline begins shortly after the start of Bølling-Allerød warming. The establishment and disappearance of no-analog communities lag temperature change by 200-500 years at Bonnet Lake and Silver Lake. The lack of synchrony in the timing of warming and no-analog community establishment at Bonnet Lake and Silver Lake, but agreement in the sequence of events, indicates that local climate is an important control on vegetation assemblages. The extension of brGDGTs to the Great Lakes Region is further supported in this study, but uncertainty in temperature estimates emphasizes the need for improved calibration datasets.","tags":["Paleoclimatology","Fossil-pollen","brGDGT"],"title":"Temperature Controls on No-Analog Community Establishment in the Great Lakes Region","type":"publication"}]
