I'm currently a postdoctoral researcher at Syracuse University in [Tripti Bhattachrya's Paleoclimate Dynamics Lab](https://trbhatta.expressions.syr.edu/) where I am using leaf wax biomarkers and isotope-enabled climate simulations to reconstruct tropical circulation from Earth's recent past. My recent interests are broad but deeply rooted in using the geologic record of past climatological and ecological changes to better understand future global change. In the past, I have used microbial biomarkers, fossil-pollen abundances, leaf-wax biomarkers, and climate simulations to understand the patterns, causes, and legacies of past climate changes.
